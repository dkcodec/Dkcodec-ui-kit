#### üì¶ Example Usage

Here's how you can use the `Button2D` and `Toggle2D` components in your project:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button2D, Toggle2D, Input2D } from 'dkcodec-ui-kit'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Basic button */}
      <Button2D>Click me</Button2D>

      {/* Custom button with size and colors */}
      <Button2D
        size='lg'
        textColor='darkblue'
        btnColor='lightblue'
        borderColor='blue'
        background='darkblue'
      >
        Custom Button
      </Button2D>

      {/* Button with additional custom class */}
      <Button2D size='sm' additionalClass='my-custom-class'>
        Small Button
      </Button2D>

      {/* Toggle Button*/}
      <Toggle2D toggleSize='xl' />

      {/* Input */}
      <Input2D inputSize='xl'>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

#### üé® Customization

You can customize the button or toggle by passing in props such as `size`, `textColor`, `btnColor`, and `background`. You can also add your own styles by passing an `additionalClass` for further styling via CSS.

For example:

```css
/* MyButton.css */
.my-custom-class {
  border: 2px solid green;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Available Sizes

- `2xl`: Very large button
- `xl`: Extra large button
- `lg`: Large button
- `md`: Medium button (default)
- `sm`: Small button

Each size option adjusts the button's or toggle's padding and border-radius to fit the design requirements.

#### üöÄ Performance Tips

- Avoid applying too many styles inline; prefer using classes when customizing heavily.
- Use the `size` prop to optimize spacing rather than adjusting margins manually.

## üåê Browser Support

UI Kit supports all modern browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
